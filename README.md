## Instructions for Digital Collection Build 

1. Scanning
    - Pick a box
    - Take some time to look at the box and select 3 images to scan. (don't take too long)
        - Look for photos with dates, or means to approximate a date
        - Look for photos with locations that you could guess on a map
    - Scan each photo 
        - TIFF
        - 6000 pixels on the long edge
        - Filename = your name + number, so for me "Devin01"
        - Save in a folder on the desktop
2. Process each photo

        - unaltered TIFF, saved as TIFF
        - JPG whose image size has been adjust to be 200 DPI
