## Instructions for Digital Collection Build 

1. Scanning
    - Pick a box
    - Take some time to look at the box and select 3 images to scan. (don't take too long)
        - Look for photos with dates, or means to approximate a date
        - Look for photos with locations that you could guess on a map
    - Scan each photo 
        - TIFF
        - 6000 pixels on the long edge
        - Filename = your name + number, so for me "Devin01"
        - Save in a folder on the desktop
2. Process each photo
    - Need two copies
        - unaltered TIFF, saved as TIFF, with color stick
        - Save as JPG 
        - Crop JPG so just photo is showing
        - adjust JPG so that it is at 300 DPI   
3. Describe each photo
    - [metadata sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K6Ubivo6DlmWapNQlWQxUxwyTXFzvGO3yH9PZFSmc9E/edit?usp=sharing)
    - upload to images folder here
4. Make the photos available
    - Upload jpg files to the cdil-coll repository images directory
